            <h4>Digital Marketing</h4> <br>
            <p>
                Digital marketing encompasses all marketing 
                efforts that use an electronic device or the internet. 
                Businesses leverage digital channels such as search engines, 
                social media, email, and other websites to connect with
                 current and prospective customers.
                 <br> <br>
                 A seasoned inbound marketer might say inbound marketing 
                 and digital marketing are virtually the same thing, but 
                 there are some minor differences. And conversations with 
                 marketers and business owners in the U.S., U.K., Asia,
                  Australia, and New Zealand,
                  I've learned a lot about how 
                  those small differences are being
                   observed across the world.

            <h4>Google Ads</h4> <br>
            <p>It's no secret that, these days, the stronger and more focused
                 your paid campaigns are, the more clicks you generate — leading 
                 to a greater probability of obtaining new customers. 
                This is why Google Ads has become increasingly popular among 
                businesses across all industries. <br> <br>
                Google Ads is a paid advertising platform that falls under 
                a marketing channel known as pay-per-click (PPC),
                 where you (the advertiser) pays per click or per impression
                  (CPM) on an ad.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="class3">
            <h4>Facebook Ads</h4> <br>
            <p>
                The process is easy. Facebook allows users to target audiences 
                through self-serve tools and it gives them analytics reports 
                that track the performance of each ad. The reach and visibility 
                can help level the playing field for an independent business that 
                wants to compete with companies with much larger budgets. <br> <br>
                Through Facebook’s Business Manager platform, businesses have a 
                one-stop shop for all their marketing and advertising needs. 
                Additional resources like access to Instagram and product catalogs are part of the mix.

        Welcome to DIGITAL RANKING, your number one source for all things. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of everything.
                Founded in 2020 by ABC, DIGITAL RANKING has come a long way from its beginnings in Delhi. <br> 
                <br> 
                Most social media platforms have built-in data analytics tools, which enable 
                companies to track the progress, success, and engagement of ad campaigns. Companies 
                address a range of stakeholders through social media marketing, including current and 
                potential customers, current and potential employees, journalists, bloggers, and the general 
                public. On a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management of a 
                marketing campaign, governance, setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the 
                establishment of a firm's desired social media "culture" and "tone."
                <br> <br>
                When using social media marketing, firms can allow customers
                 and Internet users to post user-generated content (e.g., online comments, 
                 product reviews, etc.), also known as "earned media," rather than use marketer-prepared advertising copy.
                <br> <br>
                When ABC first started out, his passion for drove them to action: quit day job, do tons of research, etc. so that DIGITAL RANKING can offer you competitive differentiator - e.g. the world's most advanced toothbrush. We now serve customers all over place - town, country, the world, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into own website. <br> <br>
                I hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
                <br> <br> Sincerely, <br>
