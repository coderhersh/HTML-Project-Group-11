                Welcome to DIGITAL RANKING, your number one source for all things. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of everything.
                Founded in 2020 by ABC, DIGITAL RANKING has come a long way from its beginnings in Delhi. <br> 
                <br> 
                Most social media platforms have built-in data analytics tools, which enable 
                companies to track the progress, success, and engagement of ad campaigns. Companies 
                address a range of stakeholders through social media marketing, including current and 
                potential customers, current and potential employees, journalists, bloggers, and the general 
                public. On a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management of a 
                marketing campaign, governance, setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the 
                establishment of a firm's desired social media "culture" and "tone."
                <br> <br>
                When using social media marketing, firms can allow customers
                 and Internet users to post user-generated content (e.g., online comments, 
                 product reviews, etc.), also known as "earned media," rather than use marketer-prepared advertising copy.
                <br> <br>
                When ABC first started out, his passion for drove them to action: quit day job, do tons of research, etc. so that DIGITAL RANKING can offer you competitive differentiator - e.g. the world's most advanced toothbrush. We now serve customers all over place - town, country, the world, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into own website. <br> <br>
                I hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
                <br> <br> Sincerely, <br>
                ABC         <br>
